		  <b>Time series and CCDC explorer in Google Earth Engine:</b> 
          We have created a suite of tools that allow the users to explore time series of
          Landsat data for any place in the world where they are available. Users can 
          load the images in different color combinations, including the original spectral
          bands, as well as vegetation indices. The tools also allow users to run the CCDC
          algorithm on the fly, and to load saved results and visualize coefficients, change
          information, synthetic imagery and more. The documentation and links to the tool can
          be found <a href="https://gee-ccdc-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a> and the
          associated paper describing the tools can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2020.576740">here</a>. The screenshot of one of the tools below shows the time when the largest change
          as detected by CCDC occurred, between the year 2000 and 2018, for a region in Brazil.
          More recent changes appear in red along the deforestation frontier, and older
          changes appear away from it. The chart at the bottom shows the Landsat time series
          for a pixel that experienced forest loss in the middle of 2017.

			<b>Time series online:</b> 
            A repo that uses Google Earth Engine, bqplot, ipyleaftlet in a jupyter 
            notebook to visualize time series of Landsat data, the images and 
            the results of runnint the break detection algorithm 'pyccd' on them.
            The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/parevalo/tstools-online">here</a>.

			<b>Sand deposition and plant establishment:</b> 
            Time series of Landsat data can capture some land dynamics that would be missed if we 
            only analyzed individual images at a time. Here we can see how seasonal flooding and drying
            of a river margin ends up in enough sand deposition that the flooding stops over time. 
            Eventually vegetation starts to grow. Timeseries shows the first short wave infrared band.

        	<b>Vegetation regrowth in the Colombian Amazon:</b>
            The slopes of the fitted segments in the time series can be mapped to reveal areas of
            regrowing vegetation. The RGB combination shows the slopes of the SWIR1 (Red), 
            NIR (Green), and SWIR2 (Blue) for segments intersecting the year 2010. A two standard 
            deviations stretch was applied to enhance the contrast. Vegetation regrowth appears 
            bright green due to negative slopes in the SWIR bands, and positive in the NIR. 
            The panel at the bottom shows the SWIR1 time series for an example pixel with 
            ongoing forest regeneration, and is marked with a crossmark in the image.

            <b>Flooding in the Colombian Amazon:</b>
            Amplitudes of the harmonic terms in the time series segments 
            can be used to reveal areas with seasonal 
            flooding, like this areas in the Eastern Colombian Amazon. The RGB combination shows 
            the annual amplitudes of the NIR (Red), SWIR1 (Green), and Red (Blue) bands. 
            A two standard deviations stretch was applied to enhance the contrast. Locations 
            with clear seasonal flooding events appear white and yellow in the image. 
            Many of these places correspond to natural grasslands and appear as light green. 
            The panel at the bottom shows the SWIR1 time series for an example pixel marked 
            with a crossmark in the image.
